## Description

This project is an AI Voice Assistant mobile application developed using React Native. It seamlessly integrates with OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E models to provide real-time voice-to-text conversion and AI-driven textual and visual responses.

## Features

- **Voice Activation**: Utilizes the `@react-native-community/voice` library to capture and convert voice input into text
- **Dynamic Conversational UI**: Displays chat messages interactively between the user and the assistant
- **Smart Response Mechanism**: Determines user intent to switch between textual and visual content generation
- **OpenAI Integration**:
  - Textual Responses: Uses ChatGPT for generating text-based replies
  - Visual Responses: Engages DALL-E for creating images based on textual descriptions

## Optimizations

- Achieved faster response times by optimizing asynchronous operations and state management
- Reduced API call overheads through the implementation of a caching mechanism
